# Dysthe-Lo-Mei equation

The present repository contains a Fourier-type pseudo-spectral solver for Dysthe-Lo-Mei equation as described in the references cited below. More precisely, we solve the dimensionless version of this equation, which corresponds to Equations (2.6) - (2.9) from the Lo & Mei (1985) paper. A very high order Runge-Kutta scheme is used for time integration. We employ also the integrating factor technique to slightly remove the stiffness. The work of this code is illustrated on a simple evolution of the ground state to the low order NLS equation. This solution can be computed analytically.
